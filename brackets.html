      <h1 id="tournament-brackets">Tournament Brackets</h1>
      <p>Each season tourney is a two-stage tournament:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A <strong>Swiss bracket</strong> lasting exactly <strong>4 rounds</strong>.</li>
        <li>An <strong>adaptive single-elimination top cut</strong> lasting <strong>0-2 rounds</strong> (given a player cap of 64 players).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Swiss bracket is seeded using results from the <strong>previous 6 season tourneys</strong>, including tourneys from the season prior. The formula is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(MatchesWon + 8) / (MatchesPlayed + 16)</code>, with ties broken randomly.</p>
      <p>Each round’s match pairings are generated using Challonge (brackets hosted in <a href="https://challonge.com/communities/rlor">the rLOR Challonge community</a>). After 4 rounds, the first-stage ranking is determined using the default Challonge method, which is Match Score followed by four tiebreakers in this order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Match Score</strong> (1 point for each match win and bye; 0.5 points for each match draw)</li>
        <li><strong>Match Tiebreaker</strong> (match wins against players with the same Match Score)</li>
        <li><strong>Median-Bucholz</strong> (the sum all all opponents’ Match Scores, with largest and smallest discarded)</li>
        <li><strong>Game Differential</strong> (the difference between game wins and losses)</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Seeding</strong>, low seed ranking higher</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After 4 rounds of Swiss, the tournament will enter a top 4 cut of the highest ranking players from the Swiss bracket. Ties are broken using the above tiebreakers.</p>
