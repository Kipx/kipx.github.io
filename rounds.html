      <h1><a href="..">rLOR Tournaments</a></h1>
      <h1 id="tournament-rounds">Tournament Rounds</h1>
      <h2 id="check-in">Check-in</h2>
      <p>The TO will announce the <strong>Round Start</strong> of each new round. After this announcement, each player playing a match that round must check-in as soon as possible by sending a DM to their opponent, by mentioning them in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#chat</code> channel, or by contacting the TO if there are any problems.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no penalties for checking-in in the <strong>15 minutes</strong> after Round Start.</li>
        <li>At <strong>15 minutes</strong> after Round Start, and at each <strong>10-minute interval</strong> afterward, if Player A in a match has checked in but Player B hasn’t, then Player B forfeits a game.</li>
        <li>
          <p>When Player B forfeits a game in this manner, Player A’s win total increments by 1. However, the game counter does <em>not</em> increment by 1.</p>
          <p><em>Example</em>: Player A checks-in after 2 minutes and Player B checks-in after 19 minutes. A &amp; B’s first game is Game 1, and Player A’s game record starts at 1-0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>At each <strong>20-minute interval</strong> after Round Start, if neither Player A nor Player B in a match have checked-in, then the tournament reduces by 1 the number of wins needed by either player to win the match.</li>
        <li>If this reduces the number of such wins to 0, then the match ends in a 0-0 draw.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="games--matches">Games &amp; Matches</h2>
      <p>All season tourney formats use Best-of-3 (Bo3) matches with the following rules. Casual tourney formats will generally follow these rules, but may differ on a tourney-by-tourney basis and may use non-Bo3 formats.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A match ends at the point reached first:
          <ul>
            <li>The match reaches 3 games played (Game 1, Game 2, and Game 3).</li>
            <li>A player reaches 2 games won (by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VICTORY</code>, by forfeit, or by surrender).</li>
            <li>The TO ends the match (by itself or as part of the round).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TIE GAME</code> (e.g. at Start of Round, both players are at 1 life and draw a Poison Puffcap) counts as a game played and increments the game counter, but doesn’t count as a [whole or partial] win or loss for either player.</p>
          <p><em>Example</em>: Player A is 1-0 and Player B is 0-1 going into Game 2, which then ends as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TIE GAME</code>. A remains 1-0, B remains 0-1, and their next game is Game 3. If A wins Game 3, A wins the match 2-0. If A &amp; B tie Game 3, A wins the match 1-0. If B wins Game 3, A &amp; B draw the match 1-1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If a player enters a game with an illegal deck, they lose that game. This deck can be either a deck not in their registered lineup or a deck in their lineup that the match format prevents them from using that particular game.</li>
        <li>If a player disconnects while in-game and can’t reconnect, they lose that game. Disconnects within the lobby are not normally a loss for either player. If one player was intentionally disconnecting, they instead forfeit that game.</li>
        <li>If the TO ends an ongoing match, it normally ends in either a 1-1 draw if both players won a game or a 0-0 draw elsewise. If one player was intentionally playing slowly, they instead forfeit all remaining games in the match.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any matches are ongoing <strong>60 minutes</strong> after Round Start, the TO <em>may</em> end the round at any time by their discretion. At <strong>Round End</strong>, players must stop all ongoing games. This is not a hard limit. <em>Player communication is important!</em> Players in ongoing games should contact the TO with an update before 60 minutes have passed, or run the risk of sudden Round End after 60 minutes.</p>
      <h2 id="match-reports">Match Reports</h2>
      <p>At the end of each match, both players must report the result of the match to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#match-results</code>. A match result is generally accepted in any of these forms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Either player posts a <em>screenshot</em> of the lobby that shows the final score.</li>
        <li>Both players report the same result.</li>
        <li>The losing player reports a score of 2-0.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All players should snap screenshots of the lobby score to be safe. In the case of lobby issues forcing multiple lobbies for a match, both players should report the final result.</p>
